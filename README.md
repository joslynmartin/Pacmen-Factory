# Pacmen-Factory

## Description
To allow this program to run, download all of the files in this repository and drag your index.html file onto a web browser. Let the page load, and then you can start adding pacmen! Once you have added your desired amount, you can click the start game button and all of the pacmen will bounce around your screen!

## Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to add some ghosts into this project to add more character of the original game. I would give the ghosts a purpose, like making a pacman disappear if the ghost bounces against it or goes over it.
